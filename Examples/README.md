# Uploading your Own Data
The main feature of Weed-AI is the ability for users to contribute their own data to the platform. 
The following is a step-by-step guide on downloading data from a popular online annotation service Labelbox,
converting it to COCO, creating the *AgContext* and metatdata files and uploading it to Weed-AI.

Alternatively, if you are using one of the other labeling services below that produces VOC annotations
follow these instructions starting at Step XX. This will explain the conversion from VOC to COCO and
subsequent upload.

## Step 1: Downloading the LabelBox JSON
Assuming you have labelled your images to the desired standard in the Labelbox editor and downloaded
the JSON, 

## Step 2: Download images, annotations and convert to COCO

## Step 2a: Convert VOC annotations to COCO (without downloading from Labelbox)

## Step 3: Generate *AgContext* and metadata JSON files 

## Step 4: Upload!

Great work, you have now contributed to the Weed-AI community and the development of opensource weed
recognition. The upload will be reviewed by the Weed-AI administrators and either accepted or rejected
based on data and annotation quality.
